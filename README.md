### Welcome to my GitHub Profile!  👋

My name is Christos and I'm a Computer Engineer student at the *National Technical University of Athens*.

I'm nearing the end of my studies, during which I've worked on a variety of projects:

- I've built a Battleship game with a GUI and an opponent AI using JavaFX 🚢
- I've created a website for Q&As using two different architectures ❓
- I've made a prototype for a mobile pantry management app using Android Studio 👩‍🍳
- I've worked on a number of projects on Image and Video processing as well as Neural Networks 💻
- I've participated in projects relating to Database Management as well as Information Systems and utilising Map-Reduce workflows 📃
- And much much more!

### All in all
I've managed, among others, to gain experience in different fields, such as: *Python, C++, C#, Java, JavaFX, Git, Javascript, NodeJS, MySQL, CQL, Apache Flink*


I hope to be able to show you some of the aforementioned projects here, as well as some of my own personal projects (Game Development 🎮, Arduino 💡 etc.)

Feel free to take a look below and contact me with anything that piques your curiosity! 😊
